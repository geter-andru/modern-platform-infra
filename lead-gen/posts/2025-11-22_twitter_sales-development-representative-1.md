Tweet 1: Hot take: LinkedIn hiring 1,000+ SDRs while founders are still trying to "crack" outbound themselves.

Tweet 2: You're not failing at sales because you need more reps.

You're failing because you're operating in a "grocery store" when your "Sahara" exists somewhere else.

Tweet 3: I spent 9 years in SaaS sales, generated $30M+ pipeline. The pattern is always the same:

Companies that struggle have contaminated customer data. They're optimizing for accidents, not strategy.

Tweet 4: Your first 10 customers often bought for the WRONG reasons:
- Personal relationships
- Timing luck  
- Heavy discounts
- Desperation purchases

You built your entire go-to-market on noise, not signal.

Tweet 5: Meanwhile, LinkedIn is hiring SDRs because they know EXACTLY where they're essential, not optional.

They're not spraying and praying. They're farming their Sahara.

Tweet 6: The companies that win don't have better products. They have better clarity on WHO structurally needs them and WHY.

Stop adding more sales motion to broken market intelligence.

Tweet 7: Question for founders: Are you scaling what actually works, or just doing more of what feels familiar?

The right customers sell for you. If you're doing all the selling, you're in the wrong market.
