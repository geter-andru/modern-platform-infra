LinkedIn just posted a Sales Development Representative role.

Here's what 90% of founders get wrong about early sales hires:

They think the problem is pipeline volume. It's not.

**The real issue? Contaminated data.**

Most startups hire SDRs to scale what feels like "working" – but those early wins were accidents masquerading as strategy. Relationship sales, heavy discounts, perfect timing luck.

Now you're paying someone $60K+ to systematically reach the wrong people with the wrong message.

**Here's what I learned generating $30M+ in pipeline across 7 SaaS companies:**

Before you hire your first SDR, answer this:
→ Do you know WHY your best customers actually bought?
→ Can you translate features into measurable ROI?
→ Are you essential in their world, or just optional?

**The Andru perspective:**
Find your "Sahara" before you scale your "grocery store" approach. One frustrated buyer with a hair-on-fire problem will outperform 100 lukewarm prospects who see you as a nice-to-have.

The right customers don't just buy – they sell FOR you.

**My recommendation:** Spend 30 days interviewing your top 3 customers. Understand their fears, their urgency, their language. THEN hire the SDR to find more people exactly like them.

Pure signal beats contaminated data every time.

@LinkedIn – curious how you think about this challenge when scaling your own sales teams?

What's been your experience? Are you scaling signal or noise?
