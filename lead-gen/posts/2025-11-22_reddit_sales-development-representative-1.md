**Title:** Why hiring your first SDR might be the worst mistake you'll make (learned this the hard way)

**Body:**

Just saw LinkedIn posting another SDR role and it reminded me of a painful lesson from my SaaS days.

Most founders hire their first sales hire when they hit some arbitrary revenue milestone or feel "too busy" to do outreach. I've watched this play out at 7+ companies, and it almost always backfires.

Here's what I learned after 9 years in SaaS sales and training 20+ sellers:

**The problem isn't capacity, it's clarity.**

When founders can't articulate why their best customers actually bought (beyond generic "we save time/money"), how can they expect an SDR to? I call this "contaminated data" - you're reverse-engineering from relationship wins, lucky timing, or discount purchases instead of understanding the pure signal of structural need.

Your SDR ends up spraying generic messages into the void because they're optimizing for noise, not signal.

**The fix:** Before you hire anyone, answer this honestly:
- Can you identify prospects who are in active pain without your solution?
- Do you know the specific business outcomes that make buying urgent vs. optional?
- Can you translate your features into ROI that finance actually cares about?

If you're still figuring this out yourself, an SDR will just amplify the confusion at 10x the cost.

I've seen technical founders burn through 3-4 sales hires before realizing the issue wasn't the people - it was the lack of a repeatable framework for identifying where they're essential, not just another nice-to-have tool.

**Question for the community:** How did you know you were ready for your first sales hire? What frameworks helped you get clarity before scaling outbound?

Curious if others have made this mistake or found better approaches.
