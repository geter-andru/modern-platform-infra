**Title:** Why your first 10 customers are probably misleading you (and how to fix it)

Just wrapped a brutal quarter where we finally hit our ARR target, but it took way longer than it should have. Got me reflecting on a pattern I've seen across 7 different SaaS companies over 9 years in sales.

**The problem:** Most of us reverse-engineer our ICP from our first wins. But those early customers often bought for the wrong reasons - existing relationships, lucky timing, heavy discounts, or because they're just early adopters who buy anything shiny.

I call this "contaminated data." You're optimizing your entire go-to-market around accidents masquerading as strategy.

**Here's what I learned the hard way:**

Your first customers fall into two buckets:
- **Grocery store wins** - they had alternatives, you got lucky
- **Sahara wins** - you solved something they literally couldn't solve elsewhere

The Sahara customers become evangelists. They sell for you in demos, give killer case studies, refer others. The grocery store customers? Transactional. They'll churn when something better/cheaper comes along.

**My framework now:**
1. Look at your happiest, most vocal customers
2. Ignore HOW they found you, focus on WHY they desperately needed you
3. Find 10 more companies with that exact same structural problem
4. Test if your messaging hits different there

**Question for the community:** How do you separate signal from noise in your early customer data? Have you caught yourself building around the wrong customer archetype?

I'm especially curious how other technical founders handle this - translating features into business outcomes is hard enough without optimizing for the wrong people.

What patterns have you noticed in your most successful vs. most forgettable customers?
