Tweet 1: Hot take: LinkedIn hiring 1,000+ SDRs while founders still think they can "founder-sell" their way to $10M ARR.

Tweet 2: I've watched this movie 100 times. Technical founder builds something brilliant, gets a few early wins, thinks they've cracked the code.

Tweet 3: Plot twist: Those early customers bought for all the wrong reasons. Relationships. Discounts. Lucky timing. Pure contaminated data.

Tweet 4: Meanwhile they're burning $50K/month optimizing for noise instead of signal. Fighting in grocery stores when their Sahara exists somewhere else.

Tweet 5: The companies that scale? They figure out where they're essential, not optional. Then they hire people who can actually articulate why.

Tweet 6: 90% of startups fail from lack of clarity, not lack of market need. Your brilliant features mean nothing if buyers can't connect them to ROI.

Tweet 7: While you're tweaking the product for the 47th time, LinkedIn is building an army to steal your best prospects.

Tweet 8: Question for founders: Are you optimizing your go-to-market based on who you THINK should buy, or who actually WILL buy?
