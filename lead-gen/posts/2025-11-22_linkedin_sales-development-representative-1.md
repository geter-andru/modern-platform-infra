LinkedIn is hiring an SDR.

While everyone's debating the death of outbound, the world's largest professional network is doubling down on human-powered sales development.

Here's what this tells us about B2B reality:

**The contaminated data problem is getting worse, not better.**

Every founder I meet says "our product sells itself" while burning through runway with 18-month sales cycles. They're optimizing for grocery store metrics when their Sahara exists somewhere else entirely.

LinkedIn knows something most don't: **clarity beats automation.**

An SDR's job isn't to spam prospects—it's to find pure signal in a world drowning in noise. To identify where you're essential, not optional. To translate features into outcomes that CFOs actually care about.

After 9 years in SaaS sales across 7 companies, I've seen this pattern: technical founders build incredible products but struggle with the translation layer. They know WHAT they built, but can't articulate WHY it matters to someone signing checks.

The right customers sell for you. But first, you have to find them.

@LinkedIn gets it—even in 2024, nothing replaces human intelligence for cutting through the noise and finding where your solution creates undeniable value.

What's your take: Is outbound dead, or are we just doing it wrong?
